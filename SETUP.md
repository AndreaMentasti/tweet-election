# Machine Setup Guide (One-Time per Collaborator)

## 0. Install Claude Code Plugin

```
claude plugin marketplace add EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
claude plugin install compound-engineering
```

## 1. Python Config

```bash
cp code/py/config_local.py.template code/py/config_local.py
```

Edit `config_local.py` → set `DATA_ROOT` to your Dropbox `data/` path.

## 2. Stata Config

Edit `global root` in `0-data_prep.do` → your local repo path.

```bash
cp code/stata/config_local.do.template code/stata/config_local.do
```

Edit `config_local.do` → set `global data_root` to your Dropbox `data/` path.

## 3. Stata on PATH

So that `stata` works from the terminal (required for Claude Code to run `.do` files).

**Prompt Claude Code with:**

> I want to put Stata onto my path on my bashrc or zshrc, whichever is most
> relevant for me. Look through my file system, find the most recent Stata
> version, and get it onto my bashrc/zshrc.

**What Claude will do:**

- Find your Stata installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\StataNow19\`)
- Detect your shell (bash → `.bashrc`, PowerShell → profile, zsh → `.zshrc`)
- Add the PATH export and a `stata` alias (the Windows executable is
  `StataSE-64.exe`, not `stata`)

**Windows gotcha — PowerShell profile location:**

PowerShell's profile path depends on where your Documents folder lives. If
Documents is redirected to OneDrive, the profile must go there, not the default
`C:\Users\<you>\Documents`. Claude should run
`$PROFILE | Format-List -Force` in PowerShell to find the correct path.
If `stata` still isn't recognized after setup, verify the profile landed in
the directory PowerShell actually reads.

**Verify:** Close and reopen terminal, then run `stata`. Stata should launch.

## 4. PDF Documentation Tools

Claude reads Stata's bundled PDF manuals when writing `.do` files. These tools
let it search and extract text efficiently instead of reading full PDFs.

```bash
pip install pdfplumber
```

`pdftotext` should already be available (bundled with Git for Windows via mingw64).
Verify: `pdftotext -v`. If missing, install poppler-utils for your OS.

## 5. Verify Pipeline

```bash
python code/py/01_data_prep.py
```

Should complete without errors.

## Important

Neither `config_local.py` nor `config_local.do` should ever appear in `git status`.
